            <h3>About me</h3>
           <p class="contnet-item"> My major is Computer Network Technology. I chose this class as elective. I like to learn how to cook, play video games and read on my spare time. Learning a lot about technology and video games really interest me alot. I am also interested in culture. I have been inspired by japanese culture since I was a young boy.
